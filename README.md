# Python Vocoder and Pitch Detection

## Overview

This Python project implements a vocoder for synthesizing speech from text and includes functionality for pitch detection in audio signals. The vocoder allows for the generation of speech-like sounds from input text, while the pitch detection component analyzes audio signals to identify the fundamental frequency (pitch) of the sound.

## Features

Vocoder Synthesis: Convert text input into speech-like sounds.
Pitch Detection: Analyze audio signals to determine the fundamental frequency.
Customization: Fine-tune vocoder parameters and pitch detection algorithms.
Compatibility: Works with various audio formats and Python environments.
